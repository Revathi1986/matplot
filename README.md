I  have merged mouse_data, study_result_data by internal merge.I find initially i had 1893 ID for mouse after dropping duplicate columns there are 1888 ID. On identifying unique number of mice , number of mice is 249. Still data has to be cleaned.
I tried to use drop duplicate code to drop unneccessary columns.I recognise there is one mouse which has been duplicated twice, in order to find it i used  duplicated code and the result is g989 mouse has been duplicated. Now I have to drop the unnecessary data , to get the value as 248.
I have created a histograph with x
